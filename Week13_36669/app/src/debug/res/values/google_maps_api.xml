    TODO: Before you run your application, you need a Google Maps API key.

    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

    https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=maps_android_backend&keyType=CLIENT_SIDE_ANDROID&r=3A:DB:56:B1:6A:72:C6:C8:E4:8F:C0:08:97:FC:00:58:CB:2B:58:6B%3Bid.ac.umn.week13_36669

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using these values:

    Package name:
    id.ac.umn.week13_36669

    SHA-1 certificate fingerprint:
    3A:DB:56:B1:6A:72:C6:C8:E4:8F:C0:08:97:FC:00:58:CB:2B:58:6B

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
